An [Expo][expo] implementation for [semantic release][semantic-release], so you don't have to bother.

![Example](docs/terminal.svg)

## How it works

Semantic release will first determine a new version based on your likings. 
Then this plugin will search for your [Expo manifest][expo-manifest] and update it accordingly. 
Not only will this update the [`version`][expo-version] property within the manifest. 
It will set the version to the [iOS `buildNumber`][expo-version-ios] and also set the [Android `versionCode`][expo-version-android] to the following schema: `{expoSDKMajor,2}0{major,2}{minor,2}{patch,2}`.

## Verify Conditions

Before such a smooth, carefree release can take place, the plugin must validate the existence of a manifest. 
This check takes place in the [verify condition][semantic-release-steps] step of semantic release.
The name of the Expo app, defined in the [`name` property][expo-name], is dumped to console to provide some feedback for successful validation.

## Prepare

This plugin writes the actual changes to the manifest during preparation.
After this step, you can [publish to Expo][expo-publish], [create a new build][expo-build] or add the changes in a [release commit][semantic-release-commit].
The [`version` property][expo-version] within the manifest is always updated. 
For Android, the previous `versionCode` is incremented by one. 
And for iOS, the new version is set as `buildNumber`. 
All of the platform specific changes are only applied when the platform is enabled.

> It is highly recommended to add the Expo manifest (`app.json`) to the [list of assets][semantic-release-assets] to include in the release commit.

## Usage

Here is an example configuration with automated changelogs, `package.json` versions, Expo and git release commits.

```json
{
    "verifyConditions": [
        "semantic-release-expo",
        "@semantic-release/changelog",
        "@semantic-release/git",
        "@semantic-release/npm"
    ],
    "prepare": [
        "semantic-release-expo",
        "@semantic-release/changelog",
        "@semantic-release/npm",
        {
            "path": "@semantic-release/git",
            "assets": [
                "CHANGELOG.md",
                "package.json",
                "package-lock.json",
                "app.json"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "publish": false,
    "success": false,
    "fail": false
}
```
